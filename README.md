# Neural Network for Regression

This project implements a simple neural network for a regression task using NumPy. The network has:
- 1 input layer
- 2 hidden layers with ReLU activation
- 1 output layer

The model is trained using gradient descent with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
